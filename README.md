# CONNECT4_PYTHON
	Connect-4 the game using Python.
	Updates and future updates
	 -Imported os library to use a funtion called environ to place the window at the center of the display screen as pygame has no option to do it. 
	 -GUI menu yet to be merged with the main program.
	
	Comments not added for the gui.py as of now. Will be adding later when merged with the main file or would try adding if I get time.
	
	For me, in Windows 10, the python folder by default is at C:\Users\USERNAME\Appdata\Local\Programs\Python\Scripts
	To install the required packages,
	Open up cmd at the described directory(Python\Scripts) and type
	
		pip install pygame
		
		pip install numpy
		
	Both libraries are not installed by default.
