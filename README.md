# CONNECT4_PYTHON
	Connect-4 the game using Python.
	Updates and future updates
	 -New File added. instructions.py. It is kind of a complicated code because pygame library dosn't allow multiline rendering easily. Copied and edited from some xda site.
	 -GAME is 99% working and good except for suggestions and final touchup and comments.
	 -GUI menu merged with the main program.
	 -PLAY & EXIT working without any issues.
	 -INSTRUCTIONS and CREDITS are working as well.
	 -INSTRUCTIONS has a back button to goto main menu.
	 -Imported os library to use a funtion called environ to place the window at the center of the display. 
	 
	 BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM:
	 	THE GAME(NOT THE CODE) HAS A BUG(more of a loophole). HUNTER WILL RECIEVE FREE SUTTA SUPPLY FOR A YEAR FROM TEJESH. HONESTLY, ANYONE FINDS IT IS GREAT. I FOUND IT RANDOMNLY WHILE PLAYING. WILL TRY TO FIX IT IF TIME PERMITS.
	
	
	IF ANYONE WANTS TO CHANGE SOMETHING, PLEASE CONVEY IT TO ME or TRY DOING IT YOURSELF.
	
	 
	 
	 WARNING: When opening gui.py some code has been altered with convienience to connect4.py. Hence when any button pressed would exit with an error. File just for reference for gui menu.
	 
	Comments not added for the gui.py as of now. Will be adding later when merged with the main file or would try adding if I get time.
	
	For me, in Windows 10, the python folder by default is at C:\Users\USERNAME\Appdata\Local\Programs\Python\Scripts
	To install the required packages,
	Open up cmd at the described directory(Python\Scripts) and type
	
		pip install pygame
		
		pip install numpy
		
	OR 
	
	TRY opening Python shell and type in those commands. 
	
	OR
	
	TRY opening cmd, type in 
		python
	and run those commands
	
	Not sure if these methods would work or not, but the first one works 100%.
	Both libraries are not installed by default.
