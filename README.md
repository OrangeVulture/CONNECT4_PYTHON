# CONNECT4_PYTHON
	Connect-4 the game using Python.
	Libraries used: pygame and numpy(make sure both of these are installed)
	Run connect4.py for the game.
	
	 
	 WARNING: When opening gui.py code has been altered with convienience to connect4.py. Hence when any button pressed would exit with an error. File just for reference for gui menu.
	
	For me, in Windows 10, the python folder by default is at C:\Users\USERNAME\Appdata\Local\Programs\Python\Scripts
	To install the required packages,
	Open up cmd at the described directory(Python\Scripts) and type
	
		pip install pygame
		
		pip install numpy

	Both libraries are not installed by default.
